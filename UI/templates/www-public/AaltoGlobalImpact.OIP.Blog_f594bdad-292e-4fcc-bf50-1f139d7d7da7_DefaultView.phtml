		I wasn’t familiar with the hackathon concept before.&nbsp; As much as I was excited about it, I had my doubts: how is it possible to combine coding and sanitation? How does ICT mix with pee? Is there an app for crap?<br>The pre-hackathon event introduced potential participants to some basic problems of organizing sanitation in the context of a developing country. In addition, those of us not familiar with coding or hackathons got a crash course on what it’s all about and why should we participate.<br>The actual event held at the Venture Garage of Aalto University in Otaniemi, Espoo surprisingly gathered less people than the pre-event. Maybe it was the early Saturday morning or chilly weather that convinced some people to stay home. Nevertheless, after great motivational speeches, presenting some ideas and casual conversation, the teams were formed. Ours had only engineers: three with environmental and two with ICT backgrounds. Not very multidisciplinary, but at least we had a common language.<br>We decided to construct an application that would allow registering and periodical monitoring of latrines built with development aid. A goal was to develop a tool for gathering data, which would hopefully result in better accountability and continuity in sanitation projects. Luckily, we received help from people with experience in field work and knowledge of recurring problems, which our tool might help to solve.<br>The development process was fun, but from time to time a bit nerve-wrecking as doubts started creeping in: will our software crash in presentation (it did), and is our application novel and new (it wasn’t).&nbsp; Nevertheless, the presentation went well, we got good feedback from the judges and got a good conversation going on.<br>As the hackathon’s theme and problem statements were challenging, finding an end-it-all miracle solution wasn’t even possible. An approach that requires very little resources and allows receiving near-instantaneous feedback, is very welcome. As from my experience, the water and sanitation sector has the tendency to be sluggish. These kinds of informal events bringing people together with different backgrounds but common interests, can create unexpected opportunities and ideas. I hope to see more of them in the future here in Finland.<br>Whether our team will continue working on this project is not the only thing that matters. I learned a lot and met cool new people while having a good time. And the best part was, of course, that our team won! Thanks again to my team members, organizers and supporters! I hope to see you all soon.<br>P.S.&nbsp; Pizza and soda were plentiful<br><br>About the author<br>Thomas Banafa is an environmental engineer focusing on water resource management and water treatment.<br>thomas.banafa@gmail.com<br>http://fi.linkedin.com/in/thomasbanafa<br><br>Helsinki Sanitation Hackathon a.k.a.
