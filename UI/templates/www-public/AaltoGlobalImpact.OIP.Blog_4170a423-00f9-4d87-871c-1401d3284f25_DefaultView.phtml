		More than half of world’s population live on less than $5 per day in local purchasing power and are in many ways excluded from the global market economy. These people in the developing world form the so called “Base of the Pyramid” -market (BOP), which differs significantly from the traditional markets in the developed countries. Tommi Rimpiläinen has studied the entrepreneurial processes in a BOP market in India in his master’s thesis “Opportunity Identification at the Base of the Pyramid”. The thesis is part of “Sustainable and user driven innovation in BOP markets” -project, which aims at increasing the economic activity of Finnish companies in the developing markets.<br><br>Although the purchasing power of a BOP consumer is small, the combined value of the 4 billion people market is substantial, and is argued to offer great business opportunities for companies seeking for new markets. As well as on profit generation, the emphasis of the BOP approach is on poverty alleviation and co-creation of new, profitable products and services together with the BOP consumers. Instead of seeing the poor only as potential consumers, they are recognized as collaborators in creating new, innovative business models, which meet the needs of those in the BOP, increase their incomes, and empower their entry into the formal economy.<br><br>The conditions in the BOP differ significantly from traditional markets, and little is known about the entrepreneurial process in BOP markets. In his thesis, Rimpiläinen addresses on how business opportunities can be identified in the BOP market and whether the process differs from the developed markets. The practical aim is to provide Finnish diagnostic sector an understanding of the market conditions in the targeted Indian BOP market and to identify elements that can be further developed into concrete business opportunities.<br>Rimpiläinen made a four week field study in the Kolli Hill region of Tamil Nadu state in India, during which he gathered data of contextual and cultural factors as well as of local health care systems. The research is qualitative and takes an ethnographic approach in order to understand cultural and physical circumstances of the BOP market.<br><br>Rimpiläinen found out that the opportunity identification process in the BOP differs considerably from the traditional markets and is highly influenced by the special BOP market characteristics. He argues that high emphasis needs to be given to information gathering, which is a considerably more challenging task than in the developed markets. In order to understand the market and identify the opportunities, local partnerships are necessary to overcome cultural and language barriers. Rimpiläinen discovered that there is a need for diagnostic services in Kolli Hills, and people are willing and able to pay for these services. This indicates that there is business potential for the diagnostic companies in the area.
