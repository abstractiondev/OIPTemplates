		<div>In view of our longer term collaboration with WDC Cape Town 2014, Aalto Global Impact took a delegation of 16 people from Aalto (professors, lecturers, staff, course coordinators, researchers and students from M.A. programs) to South Africa for the “World Design Capital – Helsinki Meets Cape Town” event. The initiative took place from 5 to 11 November and was organised in collaboration with Aalto University - Aalto Global Impact, Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT), the Finnish Embassy in Pretoria, the city of Cape Town and its local partners.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The reasons behind the visit were twofold:</div><div>For Aalto’s community, WDC Helsinki and Finnish Designers to interact with local partners/networks and showcase the legacy of Helsinki’s WDC year in the spirit of passing on the torch to their counterparts in Cape Town for 2014.</div><div>For Aalto University to develop the framework around the longer term collaboration with Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT), under the concept of Design for Urban Transformation.</div><div><br></div><div>We developed and facilitated design workshops using Aalto University’s expertise in participatory design and co-creation workshop knowledge. The two major activities co-organised by Aalto Global Impact were:</div><div>A full day open space ACCESS workshop “Design needs your voice!”.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Find out more:</div><div>http://www.aaltoglobalimpact.org/events/access-design-needs-your-voice-exploring-opportunity-gaps-cape-town-south-africa&nbsp;</div><div>A full day “Talkoot: cross-community design” workshop at RLabs (Bridgetown). More details at: http://www.aaltoglobalimpact.org/events/talkoot-cross-community-design-workshop-cape-town-south-africa&nbsp;</div><div>Aalto University’s partner in South Africa is CPUT. In view of 2014, both universities have decided to collaborate on a joint initiative under the concept of Design for Urban Transformation, which is in line with the themes of the WDC Cape Town for 2014 (reconnecting, rebuilding and repositioning the city through the transformative power of design). &nbsp;</div><div>The visit in November was seen as a contextual enquiry period for Aalto and CPUT to shape concrete areas of collaboration and joint educational programs, curriculum twinning and capacity building with partners in South Africa.</div><div>As the partnership in South Africa continues to unfold, we encourage the inclusion of the student community – from both countries and beyond. Under the banner of Aalto Global Impact, a student-driven project is in the making, bringing students and project courses along the road through Eastern African countries – where Aalto has on-going hands-on student projects – all the way to Cape Town for a special event showcasing the Helsinki – Cape Town collaboration at World Design Capital 2014.</div><div>For further details, please contact Anne.Badan(at)aalto.fi&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Various Links:&nbsp;</div><div>Official <a href="www.helsinkimeetscapetown.com" title="" target="_blank">website</a> of the event: www.helsinkimeetscapetown.com</div><div>A selection of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8k368mvye3engix/XhGKr3uXxj" title="" target="_blank">photos</a>: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8k368mvye3engix/XhGKr3uXxj</div><div>CS student <a href="https://blogs.aalto.fi/insouthafrica/" title="" target="_blank">Blog</a> on the event: https://blogs.aalto.fi/insouthafrica/</div><div>Postcard <a href="http://postcardsfromcapetown.tumblr.com/" title="" target="_blank">Photos</a> from Cape Town: http://postcardsfromcapetown.tumblr.com/</div><div><a href="http://vimeo.com/53357438" title="" target="_blank">Talkoot </a>cross-community design workshop: http://vimeo.com/53357438</div><div><br></div><div>Prof. Ashraf Jamal, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Film &amp; Documentary Dept.</div><div>Cape Town - A Psycho-geography documentary - contextual introduction of the multi-culturalism, multi-faceted Capetonian society</div><div><br></div><div>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Brg--QKCCU&amp;feature=youtu.be<br></div>
