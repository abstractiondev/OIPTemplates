		<div><div>Aalto University, Addis Ababa Institute of Technology and University of Dar es Salaam are planning a partnership to promote the effective use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in Ethiopia and Tanzania. ICTs can significantly promote socio-economic development and accelerate progress in private and public sectors. Therefore, strengthening the capacity in ICT research, education and innovation, as well as the linkages between these three cornerstones, are seen as key strategic objectives in Tanzania and Ethiopia. Both countries have a critical need for more well-trained, highly skilled and innovative graduated in ICT disciplines. Moreover, there is a demand for local, high-quality ICT research to address challenges specific to those countries. ICT research and innovations can also provide a boost to economy through commercialization and cooperation with industry, and thus promote the society’s transformation into knowledge economy.</div><div><br></div><div>The institutions involved in the proposed HEI ICI collaboration are:</div><div><ul><li>Department of Communications and Networking, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University&nbsp;<br></li><li>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Addis Ababa Institute of Technology, Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia&nbsp;<br></li><li>College of Information and Communication Technologies, University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania&nbsp;<br></li></ul></div><div>The partner institutions are among the premier units for ICT research and education in Tanzania and Ethiopia. However, both have a shortage of qualified and skilled staff members to educate and conduct research. In addition, they face a lack of appropriate research and teaching laboratory facilities, and their curricula for networking and communications engineering are outdated. The ENhANCE project proposes enhancements in engineering education, research capacity and industry outreach through collaborative activities with Aalto University. The Department of Communications and Networking in Aalto University will share its extensive knowledge and experience for the benefit of the partner institutions.</div><div><br></div><div>The overall objective of the two year project is to enhance postgraduate education and research capacity within Addis Ababa Institute of Technology and University of Dar es Salaam in the area of communications and networking, to better meet the needs of the local economy and society.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Towards that end, the ENhANCE project proposes a number of activities that will enhance existing or newly created study programs in the area of communications and networks, and strengthen the research environment and industry outreach programs. The outcomes include introduction of new courses, pedagogical methods and new Master’s level study programs in the area of communications and networking. In addition, wireless technology research tools and methodologies will be transferred, and new initiatives for the industry outreach programs will be introduced.</div></div><div><br></div>
