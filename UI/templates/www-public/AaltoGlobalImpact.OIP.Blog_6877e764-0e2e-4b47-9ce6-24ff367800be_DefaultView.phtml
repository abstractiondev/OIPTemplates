		Aalto students are invited to participate in a one-week intensive piloting of Fahrenheit 212 - an online platform to generate, share and analyze creative views on the future. Log in to f212.org anytime between 8 - 14 October to share your ideas and participate in discussions. You will have access to the analysis generated through the platform, and an opportunity to have the best entries published.<br><br>F212 is a social network platform designed to explore students’ visions of the future and to stimulate their proactivity and creativity, in order to generate innovative ideas addressing and solving major global challenges. It is a cross-cultural initiative involving students from various countries, managed by Futurlab-The Laboratory of Creative Futures at the University of Alicante in Spain. <br><br>The project is funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.<br>The platform will now be evaluated based on a one-week intensive test, during which students are invited to participate in open discussions under six themes related to global challenges. During this week (Monday October 8th to Sunday 14th) participating students are invited to join the platform, respond to an initial set of questions, and participate in at least one of the online discussions. Discussion themes include topics such as the future of work, or the future of advertising.<br><br>Upon completion, participating students and institutions will receive an overview report on results extracted from the process, and access to the data generated during the initiative. Involved institutions may also consider participating in a comparative joint publication based on the data, and developing the network through European funding programs. Students will have the opportunity to join a network of participants, and the best contributions will be selected for an online publication (with ISSN).<br><br>&nbsp;The students should take the following steps to complete the process:<br>1. Enter http://f212.org, sign up and log in.<br>2. Enter each 4 different sections (RATINGS, FORECASTS, SKILLS &amp; WISHES) and answer the related questions<br>3. Pay attention to the instructions attached to every questionnaire before starting to complete it.<br>4. Participate in 1-6 online discussions (IDEAS)<br><br><br>
