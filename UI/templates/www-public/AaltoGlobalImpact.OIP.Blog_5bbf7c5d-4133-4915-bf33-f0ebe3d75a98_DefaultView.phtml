		On the International Women’s Day on the 8th of March, the School of Electrical Engineering granted the Women and Technology Prize for Irena Bakić for the significant work she has done in the Aalto-UNICEF collaboration project in 2011-2012. Bakić worked as a project manager in a Product Development Project, in which students from Aalto and Makerere Universities together with a Ugandan community solved the challenges in the field of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH).&nbsp; <br><br>Improvements in the field of WASH are essential as the lack of proper sanitation has complex consequences in developing countries. During the project, three concrete products were developed: a hygienic water tap, a water transportation tool, and a system to follow up the hand washing and use of toilets. These products will have positive effects on health, education, and equality, and ease especially the life of girls.<br><br>The project and the technical outcomes exceeded all the expectations, and Bakić had an essential role in making the project successful. Throughout the project, Bakić was an inspiring and motivated project manager. In addition, she was an active role model for the Ugandan girls.&nbsp; <br><br>The prize was distributed from the Marja-Terttu Tanttinen fund, which aims at promoting the interest of girls and women in technology and science.
