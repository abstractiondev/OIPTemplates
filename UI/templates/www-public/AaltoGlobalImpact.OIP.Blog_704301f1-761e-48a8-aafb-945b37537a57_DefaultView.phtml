		Inspired by the Traditional Finnish way of working together, and run by local partners, Talkoot was a full day cross-community design workshop hosted at RLabs (Bridgetown), in Cape Town, South Africa, during the “World Design Capital: Helsinki Meets Cape Town” event on 10th November 2012.<br><br>In collaboration with Social Justice Coalition (SJC), Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT), RLabs and Aalto University - Aalto Global Impact, two local communities brought their respective soci(et)al challenges to the table allowing participants/beneficiaries to actively work towards delivering pragmatic innovative solutions/interventions.<br><br>The idea behind the cross-community challenge was for community members to learn from each other and co-create, whilst at the same time encouraging communities to take ownership of the proposals going forward. Instead of focusing on what the government, the city or service contractor is not currently delivering, it was about finding small scale interventions of which community themselves can be owners, process drivers and beneficiaries.<br><br>The two key challenges were revolving around the issue of waste management for communities living in illegal settlements in Khayalitscha as well as the issue of sanitation. The other challenge was around healthcare services for the patients of Athlone’s community.<br><br>In addition to the community members, Aalto University's students, professors and designers, together with Capetonian Designers contributed to the design doing event. The event concluded with presentations of the proposed interventions, followed by a Braai.<br><br>To revisit the event, go check the following links:<br>a video of the journey of one of the working groups: http://vimeo.com/53357438<br>a blog post from a Creative Sustainability student’s perspective: https://blogs.aalto.fi/insouthafrica/2012/11/24/6-0-%E2%80%93-talkoot-a-finnish-way-of-working-together-%E2%80%93-exported/<br>a selection of photos: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8k368mvye3engix/XhGKr3uXxj<br>RLabs website: www.rlabs.org<br>Social Justice Coalition: http://www.sjc.org.za/<br>Cape Peninsula University of Technology: http://sharpenyourmind.co.za/departments<br>
